# NASA Wiki
Formerly known as StarWarsWiki, our app is now a wiki-like application that utilizes the NASA API to obtain data about various information about the solar system. Information about planets, constellations, galaxies near us, and common space terms that you may not fully understand/misinterpret are available with just a few taps. 

A rating system is also present, in case you really seem to like a particular planet/constellation/galaxy. :)
